# grayt-zsh-theme
A simple, yet informative, zsh theme

## Installation
Clone the repository, preferably under `$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes`. Then, link the
theme directly in the `$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes` directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/evanthegrayt/grayt-zsh-theme.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes
ln -s $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/grayt-zsh-theme/grayt.zsh-theme $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes
```

## Screenshots
Here's a few examples, including a non-`git` directory, a clean `git` directory,
an un-clean `git` directory, and a non-zero return code.
